# NusaAgrix - Adaptive Precision Farming Platform

**NusaAgrix** is a precision farming platform designed to integrate satellite-based environmental data and field observations to support better irrigation planning, pest awareness, and location-specific nutrient management.

In its early stage, the project focuses on building a **practical, reliable, and accessible software foundation** before gradually evolving into a fully AI-driven agricultural intelligence system.

---

## Background

Agricultural systems are increasingly affected by climate variability, shifting rainfall patterns, and declining soil quality.
These changes create several challenges:

* Traditional planting schedules are no longer reliable
* Crop failure risk continues to increase
* Water and fertilizer usage often becomes inefficient
* Long-term food security faces growing pressure

Digital decision-support tools can help farmers respond to these challenges by turning environmental data into **clear, actionable insights**.

---

## Project Goals

The early-stage NusaAgrix platform is designed to:

1. Provide **environment-based planting guidance**
2. Offer **field productivity estimation** using available datasets
3. Deliver **basic pest and risk awareness indicators**
4. Support **irrigation and soil nutrient planning per location**
5. Build a strong **software and data infrastructure** for future AI integration
